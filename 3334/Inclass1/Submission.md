### About the dataset : 
(Note: The dataset you provided was text based data so i choosed another data as per our discussion. [This is the old data.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaudharyanshul/airline-reviews))

The dataset comprises detailed attributes of mobile phones, capturing various technical specifications and features, with a focus on assessing their price range. It includes 21 attributes, both categorical and continuous. 

This dataset is downloaded form this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification/data?select=train.csv

### Identifying Missing values in each Column : 

Analyzing missing values, it can be stated that there are no missing values present in any of the datasetâ€™s columns, as the percentage was 0% for all features. This means that there is no need to do imputation or data cleaning to handle missing value, which simplifies analysis and modeling.

|    | Column        |   Missing_Percentage |
|---:|:--------------|---------------------:|
|  0 | battery_power |                    0 |

| 20 | price_range   |                    0 |


### Identifying which of the categorical features are important to us: 


**Chi-square** tests to determine the importance of categorical features relative to this target.


|    | Column       |     Chi2 |   p-value |
|---:|:-------------|---------:|----------:|
|  0 | m_dep        | 28.7291  |  0.374155 |
|  1 | n_cores      | 20.5245  |  0.488294 |
|  2 | touch_screen |  3.88014 |  0.274701 |
|  3 | four_g       |  3.17988 |  0.364714 |
|  4 | blue         |  1.43214 |  0.698018 |



Based on the chi-square analysis, the top 3 most important categorical columns with respect to the "price_range" target variable are:

1. **m_dep**
2. **n_cores**
3. **touch_screen**

These columns have the highest chi-square statistics, indicating a stronger association with the target variable "price_range".

Now, lets have a look at count of each of the categorical features: 

### m_dep count

|    |   m_dep |   Count |
|---:|--------:|--------:|
|  0 |     0.1 |     320 |
|  1 |     0.2 |     213 |
|  2 |     0.8 |     208 |
|  3 |     0.5 |     205 |
|  4 |     0.7 |     200 |
|  5 |     0.3 |     199 |
|  6 |     0.9 |     195 |
|  7 |     0.6 |     186 |
|  8 |     0.4 |     168 |
|  9 |     1   |     106 |


### n_cores count

|    |   n_cores |   Count |
|---:|----------:|--------:|
|  0 |         4 |     274 |

|  2 |         8 |     256 |
|  3 |         2 |     247 |
|  4 |         3 |     246 |
|  5 |         5 |     246 |
|  6 |         1 |     242 |
|  7 |         6 |     230 |


### touch_screen count

|    |   touch_screen |   Count |
|---:|---------------:|--------:|
|  0 |              1 |    1006 |
|  1 |              0 |     994 |


### Analysis of Feature Correlations in Mobile Phone Specifications Dataset

Correlation matrix displays the nature of relationship between two numerical variables in the data set, where it varies from -1 to +1. If the value is positive, it shows a positive relation; conversely, if the value is negative, it reveals a negative relation. It is noteworthy that, despite the generally low levels of correlation between most pairs of variables, pc (primary camera megapixels) and fc (front camera megapixels) have a positive linear correlation of 0. 6446, which indicates that higher primary camera resolution is likely to be accompanied by higher front camera resolution as well.
