Dear Christina Cain ,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Machine Learning Engineer position at Google, as advertised on your careers page. With a robust background in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software development, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team.

My educational journey at Lambton College, where I am pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, has equipped me with cutting-edge knowledge and practical skills. During my time at Kantipur Engineering College, I not only excelled academically, securing a merit-based scholarship for four semesters but also honed my technical skills through hands-on projects and competitions, such as winning the LITEHACK 2020 and the LITE IDEATHON 2020.

In my professional experience as a Machine Learning Engineer at E.K. Solutions Pvt. Ltd., I have led several innovative projects that demonstrate my ability to tackle complex problems and deliver high-quality solutions. For instance, I developed a multilingual resume parser and semantic job matcher using LLaMA2, achieving impressive precision and recall metrics. I also optimized a semantic segmentation model, reducing its size by 70% and increasing its speed by 32% with minimal accuracy loss. These projects reflect my proficiency in machine learning, natural language processing, and optimization techniques.

Moreover, my role as a STEM instructor for the City of Brampton allowed me to translate complex technical concepts into engaging lessons for young students. This experience underscores my strong communication skills and my ability to inspire and mentor others.

I am particularly drawn to Google because of your commitment to innovation and excellence in technology. The opportunity to work on groundbreaking projects that have a global impact aligns perfectly with my career aspirations. I am excited about the prospect of bringing my technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and passion for innovation to Googleâ€™s team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to the success of Google. 

Sincerely,<br>
Rajan Ghimire
